        <div>
          <p>
            Bars are 32 points on your head and there we store the thoughts,
            ideas, beliefs, emotions, and considerations that we base our life
            on.
          </p>
          <p>
            Access Bars can feel like hitting the delete button on your
            computer’s cluttered hard drive – only this time, you’re creating
            space in your brain. When gently touched, effortlessly and easily
            release things like negative thought patterns, or that endless
            mental chatter keeping you awake at night that stops you from
            creating a life you love. But once released, space for the calm
            you’ve been seeking is created.
